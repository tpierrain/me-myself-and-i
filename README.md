# Track record (for my talks)

__Thomas PIERRAIN__ (aka __[use case driven](https://twitter.com/tpierrain)__ on twitter)

Loving to speak with others and to live-code on stage, I'm a big fan of [Nancy Duarte's Resonate](http://www.duarte.com/book/resonate-legacy/). As a speaker, I try to *mainstream* things I do at work (DDD, Software Craftsmanship practices, Reactive Programming and low latency stuffs, Architecture, etc.).

This is a sum-up of all my public intervention & covered topics over the last years:

 - __[2017](#in-2017)__ - Live coding, Legacy, DDD and Hexagonal Architecture
 - __[2016](#in-2016)__ - DDD, Network, Craftsmanship & Legacy
 - __[2015](#in-2015)__ - TDD, Hexagonal architecture & Craftsmanship
 - __[2014](#in-2014)__ - Reactive programming, & Refactoring techniques

## In 2017
### Live coding, Legacy, DDD and Hexagonal Architecture
This year started with our __[Legacy Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeogtrxqc38)__ tour ;-) LeanKanban FR, Devoxx FR, MixIt!, ... where __Bruno (BOUCARD)__ and I played it a lot and enjoyed having so much interest and feedback from the various audiences.

I also continued to have fun with __Jérémie GRODZISKI__ with a new prez we have made for the DDD Paris meetup: __[The art of Software Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YijGE2nq2BY)__. It's about DDD, agility and lots of bias we have all when it comes to build and design software.

Two major events in June (both in live-coding): 
 - [L'après-midi du Domain Driven Design](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/DDD-Paris/events/238799479/) : a crazy afternoon of { DDD + legacy code + live-coding } with __Bruno BOUCARD__ and __Jérémie GRODZISKI__. __[Vidéos available here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGl1Jc8ErU1xmSImIQ27Biu46C4MQHTfK)__
 - [Alistair in the Hexagone](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/DDD-Paris/events/240715351/): an exceptional event end of June in Paris (soon adverstised) where Alistair will clarify his pattern (and other related things) and I will live-code next to him to illustrate it. Fun! __[Vidéos available here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGl1Jc8ErU1w27y8-7Gdcloy1tHO7NriL)__
 
 Last but not least, Bruno and I have been invited to live-code at __[Explore DDD next September in Denver](http://exploreddd.com/speakers/)__. Can't wait! ;-)

## In 2016 

### DDD, Network, Craftsmanship & Legacy
This year, I started trying __[to reboot Domain Driven Design](http://domain-driven-design.eu/reboot)__ (DDD) with [Jérémy GRODZISKI](https://twitter.com/jgrodziski) (at DevoxxFR, then NCrafts.io). Our main objective was to make DDD wisdom & efficiency __more mainstream__. We had lots of fun to make it live but I have to admit that I'm very happy to see that this subject has met its target audience at the end of the day (being [one of the most viewed video from the last Devoxx FR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3thkx3EuiA))

Another intense moment for me at DevoxxFR was the 3 hours talk of *network mechanical sympathy* we've made with [Raphaël Luta](https://twitter.com/raphaelluta) and my friend [Cyrille Dupuydauby](https://twitter.com/Cyrdup): [Pourquoi il ne suffira pas de faire du HTTP 2.0 pour faire des applications performantes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL-euKX5XEk). We didn't have too much time to prepare it (I was very busy with the elaboration of the DDD reboot talk) but *explaining how TCP works with post-its, buckets and the audience -as the network- was really fun*. While preparing this talk, I was very impressed by Raphaël's knowledge about network and performance.

I also continued __to promote Software Craftsmanship__ this year during mainstream events with my mate [Bruno BOUCARD](https://twitter.com/brunoboucard) (at Paris JUG, during the MS experiences'16, etc.). Lots of interesting interactions with people. The climax being the __Microsoft experiences'16__ event in Paris (i.e. the new version of MS tech days in the *Palais des congrès*). After the success of our previous *Learn to craft* event at MS France last year (with [Jean-Laurent](https://twitter.com/morlhon)), Bruno and I were offered the animation of 3 sessions related to *Software Craftsmanship*. We then decided to illustrate the wide spectrum of it: from the business requirements (via Event Storming), to the app implementation (using CQRS and hexagonal architecture), including the deployment (with Docker). We also decided to ask some help from my friend [Tomasz Jaskula](https://twitter.com/tjaskula) for the animation (he was a great *domain expert* for the Event Storming BTW). The CQRS session was an opportunity for me to discover ASP.NET MVC with *dotnetcore* (to allow Docker deployment). I also drop [my CQRS sample app on github](https://github.com/tpierrain/CQRS) few days before. Putting it to github was really an interesting move since I got feedbacks from friends and experts just before the MS event.

Last but not least, I'm very proud of the __[Legacy Club](https://twitter.com/tpierrain/status/786848848660553728)__ session we built with Bruno. __A mix of inspirational storytelling, live-code and advanced techniques of refactoring__. We played it once at Agile Tour Lille (with [nice feedbacks](https://twitter.com/antoniolopezg/status/786856429386948609)), and I hope that we will have many other occasions to meet people with it again. We've been invited to play it at Lean Kanban France (we will slightly remaster it for the occasion; i.e. reducing the live-coding parts in order to improve the storytelling one).

Just before XMas, I also made a 30 minutes talk about [MS Async-Await and its related pitfalls](http://www.slideshare.net/ThomasPierrain/async-awaitoh-wait) at alt.net meetup.

## In 2015

### TDD, Hexagonal architecture & Craftsmanship
I started the year with a 3 hours talk at Devoxx FR about *Hexagonal Architecture* with [Cyrille Martraire](https://twitter.com/cyriux). Despite the fact that i) I know the topic, ii) I've written blog posts on it, and iii) Cyrille and I have already made a 30 minutes talk on it at Société Générale... I have to admit that this 3 hours *university* format was probably the most stressing experience of my entire speaker carreer (due to the lack of time we had to prepare it). At the end of the day it was some kind of Miracle ;-) We had great time and __have probably successfuly animated the biggest architecture dojo ever ;-) with more than 800 people in the room)__. 

During Devoxx this year, I also made a [Culture Craft](http://fr.slideshare.net/ThomasPierrain/culture-craft-humantalks) lightning talk that has resonate a lot with the audience (in a nutshell, I provide tips and tricks on how to wake-up and change your team or organisation's culture). This is the very same talk I've played afterwards during a *human talk* evening hosted in SocGen.

The second part of the year was dedicated to TDD with my friend Bruno Boucard. Initially motivated to talk about our developper's mental models, we end-up with a talk about TDD, trying to explain the big picture of it and giving tips and tricks for people to successfully retry the experience (note: being exclusively practicing TDD since 2005, I've probably made all possible errors with it ;-) We played it a lot to conferences or during Brown Bag Lunch sessions, and the feedback on it was very positive. 

We end up by writing a serie of french article about TDD in Programmez (see. __[Le TDD comme rempart contre nos biais](TDDCommeRempartContreNosBiais-Programmez.pdf)__)

## In 2014

### Reactive programming, & Refactoring techniques
First year for me as a public speaker, I've studied a lot and trained very hard to make it work (verbal, non-verbal). Discovering by chance what I consider the best book ever written for public speakers (*Resonate*, by Nancy Duarte), I was thrilled to share this discovery with my mate [Cyrille Dupuydauby](https://twitter.com/Cyrdup) and to use it with him in order to build our "[Basses latences, hauts débits : les secrets de la finance pour avoir des systèmes réactifs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHptUbGxXMU)" talk. Considering the warm feedbacks we had and the number of time we played this talk about Reactive Programming over the years (the core concepts, not the trendy libraries), this was a really good investment ;-)

Loving to live-code, I was also pleased to play [Refactoring de code legacy avec des trucs en "N"](http://www.programmez.com/actualites/mug-lyon-refactoring-de-code-legacy-avec-des-trucs-en-n-21635) here and there. Impressed by [David Gageot](https://twitter.com/dgageot)' usage of Golden Master to refactor legacy code in Java, I had decided to make a .NET ecosystem version of it to share it with non-java audience.
