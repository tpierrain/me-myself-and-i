## Bio
VP of Engineering in a booming European scale-up (Agicap), Thomas is a former entrepreneur, consultant, architect and eXtreme Programmer obsessed with use cases (as opposed to the solution-oriented approach that we tend to choose in our job a little too much) during more than 25 years. Also co-organizer of the DDD France (and former BDD Paris) meetups, Thomas likes to use autonomy, DDD and TDD to boost his efficiency and that of others at work.

Long-time promoter of hexagonal architecture (through articles, talks, trainings or live coding sessions - including one with Alistair Cockburn) Thomas is now advocating for a specific style of TDD called Outside-in Diamond üî∑ TDD . This fits perfectly with Alistair's pattern, and also allows for more secure, antifragile, and Domain-Driven tests to be written.


__More than 64 talks made worldwide since 2014__ (lots of live-coding sessions, talks, keynotes, etc) 

Most well-known conferences I've made as speaker: DDD Europe (Amsterdam), ¬µCon (London), Cukenfest (London), DDD eXchange (London), XP conf (Porto), Explore DDD (Denver), KanDDDinsky (Berlin), Devoxx (Paris),  NewCrafts (Paris), FlowCon (France), Lean Kanban France (Paris), SoftShake (Geneva), MS Experiences '16 (Paris), MixIT! (Lyon), BDX.io (Bordeaux), Sunny Tech (Montpellier), Agile Tour (Lille, Bordeaux), Alpes Craft (Grenoble)...

VP of Engineering dans une scale-up Europ√©enne en plein essor (Agicap), Thomas est un ancien entrepreneur, consultant, architecte et eXtreme Programmer obs√©d√© par les usages (par opposition √† l'approche orient√©e solution qu'on a un peu trop tendance √† choisir dans notre m√©tier). √âgalement co-organisateur des meetups DDD Paris et BDD Paris, Thomas aime utiliser le DDD et le TDD pour booster son efficacit√© et celle des autres au travail.

Promoteur de longue date du TDD et de l‚ÄôArchitecture Hexagonale (qu‚Äôil a m√™me eu l‚Äôoccasion de live-coder une fois aux c√¥t√© d‚ÄôAlistair Cockburn), Lors de ces 15 derni√®res ann√©es, Thomas a d√©velopp√© un style un peu particulier de TDD nomm√© : __Outside-In Diamond üî∑ TDD__. Celui-ci permet d‚Äô√©crire des tests encore plus fiables, antifragiles, mais surtout orient√©s m√©tier.


Un peu __plus de 64 talks r√©alis√©s depuis 2014 √† travers le monde__ (pleins de sessions de live-coding, quelques keynotes et beaucoup de talks)

## In 2018
### Another keynote, Event Sourcing, Example mapping, theatratical Pair programming...
The year started quite well with 2 sessions at the amazing [DDD Europe](https://dddeurope.com/2018/) conference where I talked about Bi-temporal Event Sourcing and live-coded with Bruno (with an amazing and interactive audience). A couple of weeks after, Bruno and I animated a workshop about Example Mapping during the first edition of the [School of PO](https://laconf.schoolofpo.com/). 

The very same Example Mapping workshop that we animated during [NewCrafts Paris](https://ncrafts.io/speaker/tpierrain), where I also had the chance to talk about Bi-temporal Event Sourcing (but with a brand new talk about technical challenges this time).

Then, Bruno and I did a live-coding talk illustrating the power (and challenges) of Pair Programming at [Explore DDD (Denver)](http://exploreddd.com/speakers/thomas-pierrain.html) in September and then in french at [BDX.IO](https://www.bdx.io/#/home) and  __[Becomx](http://becomx.com/)__.

Last but not least, I've made __[a keynote in french about ethics](https://www.facebook.com/582109264/posts/10156742368324265/)__ related to how software is eating the world where I talked a lot about privacy and how the "free app" model was impacted our lives much deeper than we think.

## In 2016 

### DDD, Network, Craftsmanship & Legacy
This year, I started trying __[to reboot Domain Driven Design](http://domain-driven-design.eu/reboot)__ (DDD) with [J√©r√©my GRODZISKI](https://twitter.com/jgrodziski) (at DevoxxFR, then NCrafts.io). Our main objective was to make DDD wisdom & efficiency __more mainstream__. We had lots of fun to make it live but I have to admit that I'm very happy to see that this subject has met its target audience at the end of the day (being [one of the most viewed video from the last Devoxx FR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3thkx3EuiA))

Another intense moment for me at DevoxxFR was the 3 hours talk of *network mechanical sympathy* we've made with [Rapha√´l Luta](https://twitter.com/raphaelluta) and my friend [Cyrille Dupuydauby](https://twitter.com/Cyrdup): [Pourquoi il ne suffira pas de faire du HTTP 2.0 pour faire des applications performantes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL-euKX5XEk). We didn't have too much time to prepare it (I was very busy with the elaboration of the DDD reboot talk) but *explaining how TCP works with post-its, buckets and the audience -as the network- was really fun*. While preparing this talk, I was very impressed by Rapha√´l's knowledge about network and performance.

I also continued __to promote Software Craftsmanship__ this year during mainstream events with my mate [Bruno BOUCARD](https://twitter.com/brunoboucard) (at Paris JUG, during the MS experiences'16, etc.). Lots of interesting interactions with people. The climax being the __Microsoft experiences'16__ event in Paris (i.e. the new version of MS tech days in the *Palais des congr√®s*). After the success of our previous *Learn to craft* event at MS France last year (with [Jean-Laurent](https://twitter.com/morlhon)), Bruno and I were offered the animation of 3 sessions related to *Software Craftsmanship*. We then decided to illustrate the wide spectrum of it: from the business requirements (via Event Storming), to the app implementation (using CQRS and hexagonal architecture), including the deployment (with Docker). We also decided to ask some help from my friend [Tomasz Jaskula](https://twitter.com/tjaskula) for the animation (he was a great *domain expert* for the Event Storming BTW). The CQRS session was an opportunity for me to discover ASP.NET MVC with *dotnetcore* (to allow Docker deployment). I also drop [my CQRS sample app on github](https://github.com/tpierrain/CQRS) few days before. Putting it to github was really an interesting move since I got feedbacks from friends and experts just before the MS event.

Last but not least, I'm very proud of the __[Legacy Club](https://twitter.com/tpierrain/status/786848848660553728)__ session we built with Bruno. __A mix of inspirational storytelling, live-code and advanced techniques of refactoring__. We played it once at Agile Tour Lille (with [nice feedbacks](https://twitter.com/antoniolopezg/status/786856429386948609)), and I hope that we will have many other occasions to meet people with it again. We've been invited to play it at Lean Kanban France (we will slightly remaster it for the occasion; i.e. reducing the live-coding parts in order to improve the storytelling one).

Just before XMas, I also made a 30 minutes talk about [MS Async-Await and its related pitfalls](http://www.slideshare.net/ThomasPierrain/async-awaitoh-wait) at alt.net meetup.

## In 2015

### TDD, Hexagonal architecture & Craftsmanship
I started the year with a 3 hours talk at Devoxx FR about *Hexagonal Architecture* with [Cyrille Martraire](https://twitter.com/cyriux). Despite the fact that i) I know the topic, ii) I've written blog posts on it, and iii) Cyrille and I have already made a 30 minutes talk on it at Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale... I have to admit that this 3 hours *university* format was probably the most stressing experience of my entire speaker carreer (due to the lack of time we had to prepare it). At the end of the day it was some kind of Miracle ;-) We had great time and __have probably successfuly animated the biggest architecture dojo ever ;-) with more than 800 people in the room)__. 

During Devoxx this year, I also made a [Culture Craft](http://fr.slideshare.net/ThomasPierrain/culture-craft-humantalks) lightning talk that has resonate a lot with the audience (in a nutshell, I provide tips and tricks on how to wake-up and change your team or organisation's culture). This is the very same talk I've played afterwards during a *human talk* evening hosted in SocGen.

The second part of the year was dedicated to TDD with my friend Bruno Boucard. Initially motivated to talk about our developper's mental models, we end-up with a talk about TDD, trying to explain the big picture of it and giving tips and tricks for people to successfully retry the experience (note: being exclusively practicing TDD since 2005, I've probably made all possible errors with it ;-) We played it a lot to conferences or during Brown Bag Lunch sessions, and the feedback on it was very positive. 

We end up by writing a serie of french article about TDD in Programmez (see. __[Le TDD comme rempart contre nos biais](TDDCommeRempartContreNosBiais-Programmez.pdf)__)

## In 2014

### Reactive programming, & Refactoring techniques
First year for me as a public speaker, I've studied a lot and trained very hard to make it work (verbal, non-verbal). Discovering by chance what I consider the best book ever written for public speakers (*Resonate*, by Nancy Duarte), I was thrilled to share this discovery with my mate [Cyrille Dupuydauby](https://twitter.com/Cyrdup) and to use it with him in order to build our "[Basses latences, hauts d√©bits : les secrets de la finance pour avoir des syst√®mes r√©actifs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHptUbGxXMU)" talk. Considering the warm feedbacks we had and the number of time we played this talk about Reactive Programming over the years (the core concepts, not the trendy libraries), this was a really good investment ;-)

Loving to live-code, I was also pleased to play [Refactoring de code legacy avec des trucs en "N"](http://www.programmez.com/actualites/mug-lyon-refactoring-de-code-legacy-avec-des-trucs-en-n-21635) here and there. Impressed by [David Gageot](https://twitter.com/dgageot)' usage of Golden Master to refactor legacy code in Java, I had decided to make a .NET ecosystem version of it to share it with non-java audience.
